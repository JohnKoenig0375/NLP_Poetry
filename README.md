This project will involve an experimental deployment of Natural Language Processing techniques and algorithms on an interesting type of text data - poetry. The researcher will use a publicly available English language poetry dataset to search for data insights, hidden among the lines of the poems, and then visualize the results.

The researcher will train a Word2vec model on selected English language poetry from the Renaissance and Modern periods in order to compare similarities between poems, poets, and time periods.
